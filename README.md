# Analysis of Users on Stepik

Welcome to my firt Data Science project!
Nowadays everyone hears about a lot of online courses, and people do like it)
But in truth only 5-10 % of online courses users successfully take them to the end.
I've tried to analyze the reasons of such behavior and suppose how tutors can avoid it.

I used 2 files: 'submissions_data_train.csv' and 'event_data_train.cvs'.
Unfortunalety, 'event_data_train.cvs' file didn't download because of its huge size)
OK, just look at the code!
